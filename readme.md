## 📝 Email Content Structure

The body of your email should include **clear headings** and short, informative paragraphs. Use the following structure:

### 🧩 Project Title and Description
Provide a short description (2–3 sentences) of your project and what it aims to achieve.

### ✅ User Stories Completed This Week
List all user stories or major tasks completed during the week.  
For example:
- As a user, I can register and log in using my email.  
- As an admin, I can view a list of registered users.

### 🚀 User Stories Planned for Next Week
List what you intend to complete next week.  
For example:
- Implement password reset functionality.  
- Create unit tests for the login module.

### 🌟 What Went Well
Summarize successes or milestones achieved this week.  
For example:
- Integrated authentication with no errors.  
- Team communication was effective.

### ⚠️ What Didn’t Go Well / Issues Encountered
Describe any blockers, delays, or technical issues that affected progress.  
If you mark your status as **Red** or **Orange**, briefly specify what kind of assistance you need (e.g., debugging help, clarification on requirements, time extension).

### 🌿 GitHub Submission
You must commit your weekly work to your GitHub repository using a **new branch each week**.  
- **Branch naming convention:**
  ```
  update-YYYYMMDD
  ```
  Example:  
  ```
  update-20251019
  ```
- Include your latest code, tests, and documentation in this branch.  
- Mention the branch name in your report, for example:  
  `This week’s branch: update-20251019`

## 🔁 Good Practice Recommendations
- Keep your project repository **organized and regularly updated**.  
- Write **clear commit messages** describing what each change does.  
- Use **issues or project boards** in GitHub to track your progress.  
- Communicate early if you anticipate missing a deadline.
